# FrimpieBox
Here is the Python code for my Raspberry Pi Project ["FrimpieBox"](https://frimpiebox.blogspot.com/)

# Short description
The FrimpieBox was built for my children to get rid of scratched radioplay CDs.
Since we had a lot of Skylanders (a series of Playstation games) around that contain a RFID tag, 
the idea was to build abox that contains all radioplays. Each one of the play can be associated to a Skylander.
This way the kids can choose the radioplay by a corresponding Skylander.

# Main Features
1. Automatical association of a radioplay with a RFID tag
1. Import a new radioplay via USB stick 
1. Play a radioplay (of course) by placing an associated RFID tag
1. Pausing radioplay by removing of the RFID tag
1. Shutdown after 30 minutes inactivity
1. Amplifier is just activated when needed
1. Volume setting is persisted

# Note
The Code is still Python 2.7 code and probably is quite "amateurish". 
Since this was my first experience with Python - please be lenient with me and feel free to improve it ;-)
